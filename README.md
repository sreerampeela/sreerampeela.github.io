### About

I am a Computational Biologist / Genomics Scientist with postdoctoral experience spanning:

1. Pathogen and population genomics

2. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)

3. Cancer systems biology

4. Interpretable machine learning for drug response

My work focuses on biologically grounded, interpretable computational models and large-scale genomic analyses.
